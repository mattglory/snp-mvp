# SNP Financial Model

## Revenue Model

I charge 8% performance fee on yields generated. Users only pay when they profit.

**Why 8%?**
- Yearn Finance: 20% (industry leader)
- Beefy Finance: 9.5%
- SNP: 8% (60% cheaper than Yearn, competitive with Beefy)

---

## Unit Economics

**Per $1M TVL (Annual):**
- Average APY: 15%
- Yields generated: $150,000
- My fee (8%): $12,000
- Marginal cost: ~$500
- **Contribution margin: $11,500 (96%)**

This is a high-margin business once fixed costs are covered.

**Milestones Required:**
- $10M+ TVL
- 2,000+ users
- 6+ months operational
- Clean security audit
- Governance token launched

---

## Exit Opportunities

**Most Likely: Acquisition**
- Potential buyers: Major DeFi protocols, Bitcoin companies
- Valuation: 5-10x revenue
- Timeline: Year 3-5

**Alternative: Token Launch**

## Market Validation

**Comparables:**

| Company | Peak TVL | Revenue | Valuation |
|---------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Yearn Finance | $6B | $200M+ | $1B+ |
| Beefy Finance | $400M | $6-8M | ~$100M |

I'm targeting 10-20% of Yearn's market share in Bitcoin DeFi within 5 years.
