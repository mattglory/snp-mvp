## Why I Cannot Do These Steps For You

### Google Drive

I don't have access to your Google account (requires OAuth authentication that I cannot perform). You must:
- Log in to your Google account
- Create and share the folder yourself
- Copy the shareable link

### Screenshot Location

I searched common locations but cannot access all folders on your system (permission restrictions). You'll find them faster using Windows Search (`Win + S`).

### Calendly

This requires creating an account with your email and setting your personal availability, which only you can do.

## What's Been Improved

### Before vs After Examples

```
"SNP is the first automated yield aggregator on Stacks Bitcoin L2, featuring 
three risk-adjusted vaults (Conservative, Balanced, Growth) that optimize yields 
across 12 DeFi protocols. Production-ready with 17 contracts..."
```

**After (More Personal):**
```
"I built SNP - Bitcoin's first automated yield aggregator. Set-and-forget 
yield optimization. Deposit once, earn continuously, zero manual management."
```

**Before (Team Bio):**
```
"Matt Glory is a full-stack blockchain developer with 2+ years of software 
development experience..."
```

**After (More Direct):**
```
"I'm a full-stack blockchain developer who ships production code. I've 
completed 4 Stacks projects and built SNP from concept to production in 6 months."
```
