# The Problem

Bitcoin DeFi is fragmented. Users must manually manage positions across 10+ protocols to optimize yields. This creates:
- Suboptimal returns
- Wasted time and attention
- Unnecessary complexity and risk

**The Gap:** Ethereum has $300B+ DeFi with mature yield aggregators (Yearn, Beefy). Bitcoin L2s have $161.5M TVL with ZERO automated yield optimization.

---

# My Solution: SNP

Set-and-forget yield optimization for Bitcoin. Deposit once, earn continuously, zero manual management.

## Three Risk-Adjusted Vaults

| Vault | APY | Risk | For Who |
|-------|-----|------|---------|
| Conservative | 8-10% | Low | Capital preservation |
| Balanced | 12-16% | Medium | Most users |
| Growth | 18-25% | High | Maximum returns |

**12 Protocol Integrations:** ALEX, Zest, sBTC, StackSwap, Bitflow, Arkadiko, Hermetica, Velar, STX Stacking, StackingDAO, Granite, Wrapped BTC

# What I've Built

✅ **17 production-ready smart contracts** (3,800+ lines)  
✅ **100% compilation success** (0 errors)  
✅ **86 comprehensive test cases**  
✅ **Multi-vault frontend** with portfolio dashboard  
✅ **12 DeFi protocol integrations**  
✅ **Code4STX submission** completed

This is a working product, not a concept.

# Market Opportunity

**Total Addressable Market:**
- Stacks: $161.5M TVL (Nov 2025)
- Core chain: Growing rapidly
- Combined Bitcoin L2: $500M+ and expanding

**Competition:**
| Protocol | Chain | Fee |
|----------|-------|-----|
| Yearn | Ethereum | 20% |
| Beefy | Multi-chain | 9.5% |
| **SNP** | **Bitcoin L2s** | **8%** |

I'm first to market in automated Bitcoin L2 yield aggregation. sBTC launched November 2025 - perfect timing with 3-6 month head start before competitors react.

# Business Model

**8% performance fee** on yields generated. Simple, proven model validated by Yearn Finance ($6B peak TVL, $200M+ revenue).

**Unit Economics (per $1M TVL):**
- Yields generated: $150K (15% APY)
- My revenue: $12K (8% fee)
- Margin: 96%

**Revenue Projections:**
| Year | TVL | Revenue |
|------|-----|---------|
| 1 | $5-10M | $60-120K |
| 2 | $25-50M | $300-600K |
| 3 | $100M+ | $1.2M+ |

# Go-to-Market

**Q1 2026:** Launch on Stacks mainnet after security audit. Target $1M TVL.

**Q2 2026:** Integrate Core chain (BTC-FI focus). Target $5M TVL across both chains.

**Q3-Q4 2026:** Scale marketing, launch governance token. Target $25M+ TVL.

# About Me

**Matt Glory** - Founder & Solo Developer

I've completed 4 Stacks blockchain projects and hold a LearnWeb3.io Stacks Developer Degree. I don't just talk about building - I ship production code.

**Track Record:**
- Built 17 production smart contracts for SNP
- Achieved 100% compilation success
- Created comprehensive 86-test suite
- Designed multi-vault architecture
- Integrated 12 DeFi protocols independently

I'm ready to execute, not learn. I need strategic support to scale, not hand-holding to build.
