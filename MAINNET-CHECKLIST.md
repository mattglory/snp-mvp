- Response: Strategy rebalancing, TVL cap adjustment

**Operational Risk**
- Mitigation: Multi-sig, timelock, monitoring
- Response: Incident response team, communication plan

**Market Risk**
- Mitigation: Conservative initial TVL cap, community education
- Response: Transparent communication, performance adjustments
