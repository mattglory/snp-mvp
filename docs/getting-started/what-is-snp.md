# What is SNP?

**Stacks Nexus Protocol (SNP)** is the first automated yield aggregator built specifically for Bitcoin Layer 2, bringing institutional-grade yield optimization to the Stacks ecosystem.

---

## 🎯 The Problem

Earning yield on Bitcoin Layer 2 is complex:

- **Manual Management** - Constant monitoring of 12+ DeFi protocols
- **Suboptimal Returns** - Missing opportunities across different strategies
- **High Fees** - Expensive to rebalance and compound manually
- **Technical Barriers** - Requires deep knowledge of multiple protocols
- **Time-Intensive** - Hours spent researching optimal allocations

---

## ✨ The Solution

SNP automates the entire yield generation process:

```
Your Deposit → SNP Smart Contracts → 12+ Optimized Strategies → Automated Yields
```

### What SNP Does For You:

1. **Automatic Strategy Selection** - Deploys your capital across the highest-yielding opportunities
2. **Dynamic Rebalancing** - Shifts allocations as market conditions change
3. **Compound Optimization** - Automatically reinvests earnings for maximum growth
4. **Risk Management** - Diversifies across protocols to minimize exposure
5. **Gas Optimization** - Batches operations to minimize transaction costs

---

## 🏗️ How It Works

### 1. You Deposit
Deposit STX or sBTC into one of SNP's vaults based on your risk profile:
- **Conservative Vault** - Lower risk, stable returns (~8-10% APY)
- **Balanced Vault** - Medium risk, balanced growth (~12-15% APY)
- **Growth Vault** - Higher risk, maximum yields (~18-25% APY)

### 2. SNP Deploys
Your funds are automatically allocated across 12+ DeFi strategies:
- STX Stacking (earn BTC rewards)
- ALEX DEX liquidity pools
- Zest Protocol lending
- sBTC yield strategies
- Arkadiko vaults
- Velar Finance pools
- And 6+ more protocols

### 3. SNP Optimizes
The protocol continuously:
- Monitors APY across all strategies
- Rebalances to highest-performing opportunities
- Harvests and compounds rewards
- Manages risk exposure
- Executes emergency controls if needed

### 4. You Earn
Your deposit grows automatically while you:
- Track performance in real-time
- Withdraw anytime (no lock-ups)
- Keep 98.5% of all yields
- Rest easy with automated management

## 💡 Key Innovations

### Bitcoin-Native Yield
Unlike Ethereum-based protocols, SNP leverages Bitcoin Layer 2's unique features:

**STX Stacking** - Earn BTC rewards while your STX earns DeFi yields
```
Your 1000 STX → Stacked for BTC rewards + Deployed to DeFi = Double Yield
```

**sBTC Integration** - Native Bitcoin earning yields on Layer 2
```
Your BTC → Wrapped as sBTC → Deployed across Stacks DeFi → Earn while holding BTC
```

**Cross-Bitcoin-L2** (Coming Soon) - Deploy across multiple Bitcoin L2s
```
Your capital → Stacks + Core + Rootstock = Maximum diversification
```

## 🆚 SNP vs Yearn Finance

SNP brings Yearn's proven model to Bitcoin L2 with improvements:

| Feature | Yearn Finance | SNP Protocol |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| **Ecosystem** | Ethereum | Bitcoin L2 |
| **Performance Fee** | 20% | 1.5% (87.5% lower!) |
| **Management Fee** | 2% annually | 0% |
| **User Keeps** | ~78% of yield | 98.5% of yield |
| **Native Yield** | ETH staking only | BTC Stacking rewards |
| **First Mover** | No (established) | Yes (greenfield) |
| **Competition** | High | Low (first mover) |

## 🎖️ Why SNP?

### 1. **Lower Fees = Higher Returns**
```
Example: $10,000 investment @ 15% APY for 1 year

Yearn Finance:
- Gross yield: $1,500
- Performance fee (20%): -$300
- Management fee (2%): -$200
- NET TO YOU: $1,000 (10% effective APY)

SNP:
- Gross yield: $1,500
- Performance fee (1.5%): -$22.50
- Management fee (0%): $0
- NET TO YOU: $1,477.50 (14.775% effective APY)

💰 You earn 47.75% MORE with SNP!
```

## 🌟 The Vision

**SNP is building the yield infrastructure layer for Bitcoin Layer 2.**

Just as Yearn Finance became essential infrastructure for Ethereum DeFi, SNP will power automated yield optimization across the entire Bitcoin L2 ecosystem.

We're not just building a protocol - we're building the foundation that other protocols will integrate into their own products.

**Welcome to the future of Bitcoin L2 yields.**
