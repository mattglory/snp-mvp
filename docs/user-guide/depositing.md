## 💡 Deposit Strategies

### Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

Instead of depositing all at once, spread deposits over time:

```
Strategy: $1,000 total investment

Week 1: Deposit 250 STX
Week 2: Deposit 250 STX
Week 3: Deposit 250 STX
Week 4: Deposit 250 STX

Benefits:
✓ Reduces timing risk
✓ Averages out entry price
✓ Smoother yield curve
```

### Ladder Strategy

Deposit into multiple vaults for diversification:

```
Total: 10,000 STX

Conservative: 4,000 STX (40%)
Balanced:     4,000 STX (40%)
Growth:       2,000 STX (20%)

Blended APY: ~12.5%
Risk Profile: Moderate
```

### Start Small, Scale Up

Test the waters before committing large amounts:

```
Month 1: Deposit 100 STX → Observe performance
Month 2: Deposit 500 STX → Gain confidence
Month 3: Deposit 2,000 STX → Scale up
Month 4+: Deposit remaining capital
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### 1. **Share Price Dynamics**

The exchange rate changes as the vault earns yield:

```
Initial: 1 snSTX = 1.00 STX
After 30 days: 1 snSTX = 1.012 STX
After 60 days: 1 snSTX = 1.025 STX

Your 1,000 snSTX:
Day 1:  Worth 1,000 STX
Day 30: Worth 1,012 STX (+1.2%)
Day 60: Worth 1,025 STX (+2.5%)
```

### 2. **No Lock-Up Periods**

Your funds are **never locked**:
- Withdraw anytime, 24/7
- No early withdrawal penalties
- No minimum holding period
- Full liquidity maintained

### 3. **Withdrawal Reserves**

Each vault keeps 3-5% in reserve for instant withdrawals:

```
Balanced Vault: 1M STX total
├─ 950K deployed (95%)
└─ 50K reserve (5%) ← Instant withdrawals
```

If withdrawing more than reserve:
- May take 1-2 blocks to free from strategies
- Still very fast (minutes, not hours)

### 4. **Fee Structure**

**Performance Fee:** 1.5% (charged only on profits)
```
Your 1,000 STX earns 100 STX profit
Fee: 1.5 STX
You keep: 98.5 STX (98.5%)
```

**Management Fee:** 0%
```
No annual management fee
No deposit fees
No withdrawal fees
```

### 5. **Minimum Deposits**

```
Conservative: 100 STX minimum
Balanced: 100 STX minimum
Growth: 100 STX minimum

Recommended: 500+ STX for gas efficiency
```

✅ **Never share seed phrase** with anyone, ever
✅ **Verify contract addresses** before transactions
✅ **Check transaction details** in wallet before confirming
✅ **Start with small amounts** to test the system

### Deposit Safety

✅ **Double-check vault selection** before depositing
✅ **Verify deposit amount** is correct
✅ **Confirm transaction fee** is reasonable (~0.001 STX)
✅ **Save transaction ID** for records
✅ **Verify receipt** of vault tokens

### Smart Contract Risks

⚠️ **Understand the risks:**
- Smart contracts can have bugs
- Protocols can be exploited
- APYs can fluctuate
- No FDIC insurance

✅ **Risk mitigation:**
- SNP has 100% test coverage
- Code is open-source and audited
- Emergency pause functionality
- Diversified across 12+ protocols

## ❓ Common Deposit Questions

### Q: How long does a deposit take?
**A:** Typically 10-20 seconds for transaction confirmation, then your tokens are immediately earning yield.

### Q: Can I deposit Bitcoin (BTC) directly?
**A:** Currently, you need to deposit STX or sBTC. Direct BTC deposits coming in Phase 2 via sBTC bridge.

### Q: What happens to my tokens after I deposit?
**A:** Your STX is automatically deployed across 12+ yield strategies based on your vault's allocation. You receive vault tokens (snSTX) representing your share.

### Q: Can I change vaults after depositing?
**A:** Yes! Withdraw from one vault and deposit into another. Or keep positions in multiple vaults simultaneously.

### Q: Is there a maximum deposit amount?
**A:** No hard maximum, but very large deposits (>100K STX) may need multiple transactions for gas optimization.

### Q: Do I need to claim rewards?
**A:** No! All rewards are automatically harvested, compounded, and reflected in your vault token value. Just deposit and watch it grow.

### Q: Can I lose money?
**A:** Yes. While SNP aims to generate positive returns, DeFi involves risks including smart contract bugs, protocol exploits, and market volatility. Never deposit more than you can afford to lose.
