## 📊 Performance Fee Breakdown

### How It Works

```
Performance Fee: 1.5% of realized profits

Example:
├─ Your deposit: 10,000 STX
├─ Strategy earns: +1,000 STX profit
├─ Performance fee: 15 STX (1.5% of 1,000)
├─ You keep: 985 STX (98.5%)
└─ Total position: 10,985 STX
```

### When It's Charged

```
Fee is charged during harvest cycles:

Harvest #1 (Day 3):
├─ Profit since last: +50 STX
├─ Fee: 0.75 STX
└─ Net to you: 49.25 STX

Harvest #2 (Day 6):
├─ Profit since last: +45 STX
├─ Fee: 0.675 STX
└─ Net to you: 44.325 STX

Harvest #3 (Day 9):
├─ Profit since last: +55 STX
├─ Fee: 0.825 STX
└─ Net to you: 54.175 STX

Total over 9 days:
├─ Gross profit: 150 STX
├─ Total fees: 2.25 STX (1.5%)
└─ Your earnings: 147.75 STX (98.5%)
```

### Only on Profits

```
Scenario: Strategy Has Loss

Month 1: +100 STX profit → 1.5 STX fee ✓
Month 2: -50 STX loss → 0 STX fee ✓
Month 3: +80 STX profit → 1.2 STX fee ✓

Total P&L: +130 STX
Total fees: 2.7 STX (1.5% of gross gains)

You're NEVER charged fees on losses!
```

## 💡 Fee Optimization Tips

### Strategy 1: Long-Term Holding

```
Compounding amplifies returns:

Year 1:
├─ Profit: 1,280 STX
├─ Fee: 19.2 STX
└─ Net: 1,260.8 STX

Year 2 (on larger base):
├─ Profit: 1,436.5 STX
├─ Fee: 21.5 STX
└─ Net: 1,415 STX

Year 3 (on even larger base):
├─ Profit: 1,610.5 STX
├─ Fee: 24.2 STX
└─ Net: 1,586.3 STX

Total 3 years:
├─ Total profit: 4,262 STX
├─ Total fees: 64 STX (1.5%)
└─ Net earnings: 4,198 STX

Longer holding = More compounding
More compounding = Higher absolute returns
Higher returns = Fee becomes less significant
```

### Strategy 2: Minimize Withdrawals

```
Frequent withdrawals reset compounding:

Scenario A: Hold 1 Year
├─ Continuous compounding
├─ Final value: 11,280 STX
└─ Effective gain: 12.8%

Scenario B: Withdraw Monthly
├─ 12 withdrawal cycles
├─ Missed compounding periods
├─ Final value: 11,200 STX
└─ Effective gain: 12%

Difference: 80 STX less
Just by frequent withdrawals!

Best Practice:
└─ Deposit and hold for maximum efficiency
```

### Strategy 3: Vault Selection

```
Choose vault matching your goals:

Short-term (< 6 months):
└─ Conservative Vault
   └─ Lower volatility
   └─ Predictable fees
   └─ ~1.5% total fees

Medium-term (6-18 months):
└─ Balanced Vault
   └─ Optimal risk/reward
   └─ Moderate fees
   └─ ~1.5% total fees

Long-term (18+ months):
└─ Growth Vault
   └─ Higher absolute gains
   └─ Fees offset by returns
   └─ ~1.5% total fees

Note: Fee rate same (1.5%)
Higher returns = higher absolute fees
But also higher net profit!

## ❓ Fee FAQ

### Q: When exactly are fees charged?
**A:** During harvest cycles (every 24-72 hours) when profits are realized and compounded. You'll see fee deduction in your transaction history.

### Q: Do I pay fees on my initial deposit?
**A:** No. Zero deposit fees. You deposit 1,000 STX, the full 1,000 STX goes to work.

### Q: What if a strategy loses money?
**A:** No fee charged. Performance fees are only on profits, never on losses or principal.

### Q: Are fees tax deductible?
**A:** Possibly, depending on your jurisdiction. Consult a tax professional. SNP provides transaction history for tax purposes.

### Q: Can fees be paid in a different token?
**A:** No. Fees are deducted from the earned yield in the same asset (STX or sBTC).

### Q: How do SNP's fees compare to TradFi?
**A:** Traditional fund managers typically charge 2% management + 20% performance = much higher. SNP is 0% management + 1.5% performance.

### Q: Do I see gross or net APY on the dashboard?
**A:** NET APY after fees. What you see is what you get. Unlike competitors who show gross APY.

### Q: What are gas fees used for?
**A:** Gas fees go to Stacks validators who process transactions. SNP doesn't receive gas fees.

### Q: Can I avoid the performance fee?
**A:** No. It's automatic and built into the smart contracts. But at 1.5%, it's among the lowest in DeFi.

### Q: Why is the fee split three ways?
**A:** 
- Protocol (0.5%): Operations, development, security
- Strategist (0.3%): Incentivize strategy creation
- DAO (0.7%): Community treasury, grants, buybacks

This ensures sustainable ecosystem growth.

Protocol B: 15% APY - 22% fees = 11.7% net
SNP: 13% APY - 1.5% fees = 12.8% net

Higher net return at SNP despite lower gross APY!

Focus on what you KEEP, not what's advertised.
